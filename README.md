## Hi there 👋, i am Lerato Mokaloba!

💻 I’m currently a frontend development student at CodeSpace, learning how to build responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌱 I’m currently learning:

  <img src="assets/git.png" width="20"/> Git & GitHub  
  <img src="assets/responsive.png" width="20"/> Responsive Web Design  
  <img src="assets/javascript.png" width="20"/> JavaScript (Basics)

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- CSS Frameworks and Tailwind     
- Responsive Design
- Building my personal portfolio site

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Beginner-friendly frontend projects
- Simple website or landing page ideas

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Making my projects more responsive to all devices  
- Writing cleaner CSS and improving layouts    
- Improving the look and feel of my portfolio
